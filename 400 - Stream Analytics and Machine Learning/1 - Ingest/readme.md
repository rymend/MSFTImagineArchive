You are the leader of a group of climate scientists who are concerned about the dwindling polar-bear population in the Arctic. As such, your team has placed hundreds of motion-activated cameras at strategic locations throughout the region. Rather than manually examine each photograph to determine whether it contains a polar bear, you have been challenged to devise an automated system that processes data from these cameras in real time and displays an alert on a map when a polar bear is photographed. You need a solution that incorporates real-time stream processing to analyze raw data for potential sightings, and one that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to determine with a high degree of accuracy whether a photo contains a polar bear. And you need it fast, because climate change won't wait.

In a series of four hands-on labs, you will build such a system using [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) and [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/). Specifically, you will use an [Azure IoT hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-hub/) to ingest streaming data from simulated cameras, [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/?v=16.50) to store photographs, [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics/) to process real-time data streams, [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/) to process output from Stream Analytics, Microsoft's [Custom Vision Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/) to analyze photographs for polar pears, [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) to build a dashboard for visualizing results, and [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/) as a data source for Power BI.

In this lab, you will create a storage account and an IoT hub and write a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) app that connects them to a simulated camera array. Then you will test one of the virtual cameras by having it upload a photograph to blob storage and transmit an event containing the blob URL and other information to the IoT hub.

## Exercises ##

This hands-on lab includes the following exercises:

- [Exercise 1: Create a storage account](#Exercise1)
- [Exercise 2: Create an IoT hub](#Exercise2)
- [Exercise 3: Deploy a simulated camera array](#Exercise3)
- [Exercise 4: Test the simulated camera array](#Exercise4)

Estimated time to complete this lab: **30** minutes.

<a name="Exercise1"></a>
## Exercise 1: Create a storage account ##

In this exercise, you will use the Azure CLI to create an Azure storage account in the cloud. This storage account will store as blobs photographs taken by the simulated cameras that you deploy. Note that you can also create storage accounts using the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). Whether to use the CLI or the portal is often a matter of personal preference.

1. If the Azure CLI 2.0 isn't installed on your computer, go to https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli and install it now. You can determine whether the CLI is installed — and what version is installed — by opening a Command Prompt or terminal window and typing the following command:

	```
	az -v
	```

	If the CLI is installed, the version number will be displayed. If the version number is less than 2.0.23, **download and install the latest version**.

	> As an alternative to installing the Azure CLI, you can use the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/cloud-shell/) available in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). Simply open the portal in your browser and click the **Cloud Shell** button in the toolbar at the top of the page. One of the benefits of using the Cloud Shell is that you're *always* running the latest version.

	![Opening the Azure Cloud Shell](Images/cloud-shell.png)

	_Opening the Azure Cloud Shell_

1. The next task is to create a resource group to hold the storage account and other Azure resources that make up the solution you're building. Execute the following command in a Command Prompt window or terminal window (or in the Azure Cloud Shell) to create a resource group named "streaminglab-rg" in Azure's South Central US region:

	```
	az group create --name streaminglab-rg --location southcentralus
	```

	> If the CLI responds by saying you must log in to execute this command, type ```az login``` and follow the instructions on the screen to log in to the CLI. In addition, if you have multiple Azure subscriptions, follow the instructions at https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/manage-azure-subscriptions-azure-cli to set the active subscription — the one that the resources you create with the CLI will be billed to.

1. Now use the following command to create a general-purpose storage account in the "streaminglab-rg" resource group. Replace ACCOUNT_NAME with the name you wish to assign the storage account. The account name must be unique within Azure, so if the command fails because the storage-account name is already in use, change the name and try again. In addition, storage-account names must be from 3 to 24 characters in length and can contain only numbers and lowercase letters.

	```
	az storage account create --name ACCOUNT_NAME --resource-group streaminglab-rg --location southcentralus --kind Storage --sku Standard_LRS
	```

1. Before you can upload blobs to a storage account, you must create a container to store them in. Use the following command to create a container named "photos" in the storage account, replacing ACCOUNT_NAME with the name you assigned to the storage account in the previous step:

	```
	az storage container create --name photos --account-name ACCOUNT_NAME
	```

You now have a storage account for storing photos taken by your simulated cameras, and a container to store them in. Now let's create an IoT hub to receive events transmitted by the cameras.

<a name="Exercise2"></a>
## Exercise 2: Create an IoT hub ##

Azure Stream Analytics supports several types of input, including input from [Azure IoT hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-hub/). In the IoT world, data is easily transmitted to IoT hubs through field gateways (for devices that are not IP-capable) or cloud gateways (for devices that *are* IP-capable), and a single Azure IoT hub can handle millions of events per second from devices spread throughout the world. IoT hubs support secure two-way communications with the devices connected to them using a variety of transport protocols.

In this exercise, you will create an Azure IoT hub to receive input from a simulated camera array.

1. Use the following command to create an IoT Hub in the same region as the storage account you created in the previous exercise and place it in the "streaminglab-rg" resource group. Replace HUB_NAME with an IoT hub name, which must be unique across Azure and conform to DNS naming conventions.

	```
	az iot hub create --name HUB_NAME --resource-group streaminglab-rg --location southcentralus --sku F1 
	```

	> The ```--sku F1``` parameter configures the IoT hub to use the free F1 pricing tier, which supports up to 8,000 events per day. However, Azure subscriptions are limited to one free IoT hub each. If the command fails because you have already created a free IoT hub, specify ```--sku S1``` instead. The S1 tier greatly expands the message-per-day limit, but is not free.

1. Use the following command to retrieve a connection string for the IoT hub, replacing HUB_NAME with the name you assigned to the IoT hub in the previous step:

	```
	az iot hub show-connection-string --name HUB_NAME
	```

1. Copy the connection-string value from the output and paste it into a text file so you can retrieve it later. That value will be of the form:

	```
	HostName=HUB_NAME.azure-devices.net;SharedAccessKeyName=iothubowner;SharedAccessKey=KEY_VALUE
	```

	Where HUB_NAME is the name of your IoT hub, and KEY_VALUE is the hub's shared access key.

The connection string that you just retrieved is important, because it will enable the app that you build in the next exercise to connect to the IoT hub securely and register an array of virtual devices.

<a name="Exercise3"></a>
## Exercise 3: Deploy a simulated camera array ##

Devices that transmit events to an Azure IoT hub must first be registered with that IoT hub. Once registered, a device can send events to the IoT hub using one of several protocols, including HTTPS, [AMPQ](http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-complete-v1.0-os.pdf), and [MQTT](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/mqtt-v3.1.1.pdf). Calls must be authenticated, and IoT hubs support several forms of authentication as described in [Control access to IoT hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-security). In this exercise, you will create a Node.js app that registers an array of simulated cameras with the IoT hub you created in the previous exercise.

1. If Node.js isn't installed on your computer, go to https://nodejs.org/ and install it it now. You can determine whether Node is installed — and what version is installed — by opening a Command Prompt or terminal window and typing the following command:

	```
	node -v
	```

	If Node is installed, the version number will be displayed. If the version number is less than 8.0, **download and install the latest version**.

1. Create a directory on your hard disk to serve as the project directory. Then ```cd``` to that directory in a Command Prompt or terminal window.

1. Execute the following commands in sequence to initialize the project directory to host a Node project and install a trio of packages that Node can use to communicate with Azure IoT hubs:

	```
	npm init -y
	npm install azure-iothub --save
	npm install azure-iot-device azure-iot-device-mqtt --save
	```

	The [azure-iothub](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-iothub) package provides APIs for registering devices with IoT hubs and managing device identities, while [azure-iot-device](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-iot-device) and [azure-iot-device-mqtt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-iot-device-mqtt) enable devices to connect to IoT hubs and transmit events using the MQTT protocol.

1. Wait for the installs to finish. Then create a file named **devices.json** in the project directory and paste in the following JSON:

	```json
	[
	    {
	        "deviceId" : "polar_cam_0001",
	        "latitude" : 75.401451,
	        "longitude" : -95.722518,
	        "key" : ""
	    },
	    {
	        "deviceId" : "polar_cam_0002",
	        "latitude" : 75.027715,
	        "longitude" : -96.041859,
	        "key" : ""
	    },
	    {
	        "deviceId" : "polar_cam_0003",
	        "latitude" : 74.996653,
	        "longitude" : -96.601780,
	        "key" : ""
	    },
	    {
	        "deviceId" : "polar_cam_0004",
	        "latitude" : 75.247701,
	        "longitude" : -96.074436,
	        "key" : ""
	    },
	    {
	        "deviceId" : "polar_cam_0005",
	        "latitude" : 75.044926,
	        "longitude" : -93.651951,
	        "key" : ""
	    },
	    {
	        "deviceId" : "polar_cam_0006",
	        "latitude" : 75.601571,
	        "longitude" : -95.294407,
	        "key" : ""
	    },
	    {
	        "deviceId" : "polar_cam_0007",
	        "latitude" : 74.763102,
	        "longitude" : -95.091160,
	        "key" : ""
	    },
	    {
	        "deviceId" : "polar_cam_0008",
	        "latitude" : 75.473988,
	        "longitude" : -94.069432,
	        "key" : ""
	    },
	    {
	        "deviceId" : "polar_cam_0009",
	        "latitude" : 75.232307,
	        "longitude" : -96.277683,
	        "key" : ""
	    },
	    {
	        "deviceId" : "polar_cam_0010",
	        "latitude" : 74.658811,
	        "longitude" : -93.783787,
	        "key" : ""
	    }
	]
	```

	This file defines ten virtual cameras that will transmit events to the IoT hub. Each "camera" contains a device ID, a latitude and a longitude specifying the camera's location, and an access key for per-device authentication. The ```key``` values are empty for now, but that will change once the cameras are registered with the IoT hub.

	> The latitudes and longitudes are for points on the coast of Northern Canada's [Cornwallis Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornwallis_Island_(Nunavut)), which is one of the best sites in all of Canada to spot polar bears. It is also adjacent to [Bathurst Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathurst_Island_(Nunavut)), which is home to the [Polar Bear Pass National Wildlife Area](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/national-wildlife-areas/locations/polar-bear-pass.html).

1. Add a file named **deploy.js** to the project directory and insert the following JavaScript code:

	```javascript
	var fs = require('fs');
	var iothub = require('azure-iothub');
	var registry = iothub.Registry.fromConnectionString('CONNECTION_STRING');
	
	console.log('Reading devices.json...');
	var devices = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('devices.json', 'utf8'));
	
	console.log('Registering devices...');
	registry.addDevices(devices, (err, info, res) => {
	    registry.list((err, info, res) => {
	        info.forEach(device => {
	            devices.find(o => o.deviceId === device.deviceId).key = device.authentication.symmetricKey.primaryKey;          
	        });
	
	        console.log('Writing cameras.json...');
	        fs.writeFileSync('cameras.json', JSON.stringify(devices, null, 4), 'utf8');
	        console.log('Done');
	    });
	});
	```

	This code registers all the simulated devices defined in **devices.json** with the IoT hub that you created earlier. It also retrieves from the IoT hub the access key created for each device and creates a new file named **cameras.json** that contains the same information as **devices.json**, but with a value assigned to each device's ```key``` property. It is this key, which is transmitted in each request, that enables a device to authenticate to the IoT hub.

1. Replace CONNECTION_STRING on line 3 of **deploy.js** with the connection string that you saved in Step 3 of the previous exercise. Then save the file.

1. Return to the Command Prompt or terminal window and execute the following command to run **deploy.js**:

	```
	node deploy.js
	```

	Confirm that the output looks like this:

	```
	Reading devices.json...
	Registering devices...
	Writing cameras.json...
	Done
	```

1. Use the following command to confirm that 10 devices were registered with your IoT hub, replacing HUB_NAME with the IoT hub's name:

	```
	az iot device list --hub-name HUB_NAME
	```

Finish up by verifying that a file named **cameras.json** was created in the project directory Open the file and view its contents. Confirm that the ```key``` properties which are empty strings in **devices.json** have values in **cameras.json**.

<a name="Exercise4"></a>
## Exercise 4: Test the simulated camera array ##

In this exercise, you will write code to test the camera array that you deployed in the previous exercise. That code will transmit an event from one of the virtual cameras to the IoT hub, and it will upload an image to the storage account that you created in [Exercise 1](#Exercise1).

1. Create a subdirectory named "photos" in the project directory that you created in the previous exercise. Then copy all 30 JPG files from the [resources that accompany this lab](https://topcs.blob.core.windows.net/public/400-streaming-resources-01.zip) to the "photos" directory. These are the images that the simulated cameras will upload to blob storage, samples of which are shown below. Wildlife depicted in the images include Arctic foxes, polar bears, and walruses.

	![Sample wildlife images](Images/wildlife-images.png)

1. In a Command Prompt or terminal window with the project directory as the current directory, execute the following command to install the [Microsoft Azure Storage SDK for Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-storage):

	```
	npm install azure-storage --save
	```

	This package provides a programmatic interface to Azure storage, including blob storage.

1. Add a file named **test.js** to the project directory and insert the following code:

	```javascript
	var iotHubName = 'HUB_NAME';
	var storageAccountName = 'ACCOUNT_NAME';
	var storageAccountKey = 'ACCOUNT_KEY';
	
	// Upload an image to blob storage
	var azure = require('azure-storage');
	var blobService = azure.createBlobService(storageAccountName, storageAccountKey);
	
	blobService.createBlockBlobFromLocalFile('photos', 'image_19.jpg', 'photos/image_19.jpg', (err, result, response) => {
	    if (err) {
	        console.log('Error uploading blob: ' + err);
	    }
	    else {
	        console.log("Blob uploaded");
	
	        // Get information about polar_cam_0003 from cameras.js
	        var fs = require('fs');
	        var cameras = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('cameras.json', 'utf8'));
	        var camera = cameras.find(o => o.deviceId === 'polar_cam_0003');
	
	        // Send an event to the IoT hub and include the blob's URL
	        var Message = require('azure-iot-device').Message;
	        var connectionString = 'HostName=' + iotHubName + '.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=' + camera.deviceId + ';SharedAccessKey=' + camera.key;
	        var clientFromConnectionString = require('azure-iot-device-mqtt').clientFromConnectionString;
	        var client = clientFromConnectionString(connectionString);
	
	        client.open(err => {
	            if (err) {
	                console.log('Error connecting to IoT hub: ' + err);
	            }
	            else {
	                var data = {
	                    'deviceId' : camera.deviceId,
	                    'latitude' : camera.latitude,
	                    'longitude' : camera.longitude,
	                    'url' : 'https://' + storageAccountName + '.blob.core.windows.net/photos/image_19.jpg',
	                    'timestamp' : new Date().toISOString()
	                };
	
	                var message = new Message(JSON.stringify(data));
	
	                client.sendEvent(message, (err, result) => {
	                    if (err) {
	                        console.log('Error sending event: ' + err);
	                    }
	                    else {
	                        console.log("Event transmitted");                
	                    }
	                });
	            }
	        });
	    }
	});
	```

	This code uploads the file named **image_19.jpg** from the current directory's "photos" subdirectory to the storage account's "photos" container. Then it opens a connection from ```polar_cam_0003``` to the IoT hub using ```polar_cam_0003```'s access key (which comes from **cameras.js**) and transmits a message containing a JSON payload over MQTT. That message includes a camera ID, a latitude and longitude, the URL of the blob that was uploaded, and the event time.

1. Replace HUB_NAME on line 1 of **test.js** with the name of the IoT hub you created in [Exercise 2](#Exercise2), and ACCOUNT_NAME on line 2 with the name of the storage account that you created in [Exercise 1](#Exercise1).

1. Return to the Command Prompt or terminal window and use the following command to list the access keys for the storage account, replacing ACCOUNT_NAME with the name of your storage account:

	```
	az storage account keys list --account-name ACCOUNT_NAME --resource-group streaminglab-rg
	```

	By default, blobs stored in an Azure storage account are private and are only accessible to persons who have access to the subscription under which the account was created. Access keys allow other parties, including apps, to access the contents of a storage account. You should treat access keys with great care and **never** give them to someone you don't trust.

1. Copy the ```value``` property of either of the two keys that is displayed in the command output to the clipboard. Then replace ACCOUNT_KEY on line 3 of **test.js** with the access key. That line should now look something like this:

	```javascript
	var storageAccountKey = 'doPZd+uLueiDMY0JWtg...qWtWfmJLVkTe/huqlTliq8ruy8L1lzmDV9l6HkRw==';
	```

1. Save **test.js**, and then run it with the following command:

	```
	node test.js
	```

	Confirm that you see the following output indicating that the command completed successfully:

	```
	Blob uploaded
	Event transmitted
	```

1. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) in your browser. If asked to log in, do so using your Microsoft account.

1. Click **Resource groups** in the ribbon on the left, and then click the "streaminglab-rg" resource group to view its contents.

	![Opening the resource group](Images/open-resource-group.png)

	_Opening the resource group_

1. Click the storage account that you created in [Exercise 1](#Exercise1).

	![Opening the storage account](Images/open-storage-account.png)

	_Opening the storage account_

1. In the blade for the storage account, click **Blobs** to view a list of blob containers.

    ![Viewing blob containers](Images/open-blob-storage.png)

    _Viewing blob containers_

1. Click **photos** to open the "photos" container.

	![Opening the "photos" container](Images/open-container.png)

	_Opening the "photos" container_

1. Click the blob named **image_19.jpg**.

	![Opening the blob containing the photo uploaded to the container](Images/open-blob.png)

	_Opening the blob containing the photo uploaded to the container_

1. Click **Download** to download the blob. Confirm that it contains a small (64x64) grayscale polar-bear image.

	![Downloading the blob](Images/download-blob.png)

	_Downloading the blob_

1. Return to the "streaminglab-rg" resource group in the portal and click the IoT hub.

	![Opening the IoT hub](Images/open-iot-hub.png)

	_Opening the IoT hub_

1. Confirm that at least one message has been received by the IoT hub, and that it has 10 devices registered. These are the simulated cameras that you registered in the previous exercise.

	![IoT hub overview](Images/iot-hub-overview.png)

	_IoT hub overview_

If you would like to see a list of devices registered with the IoT hub, click **IoT Devices** in the menu on the left. If you then click one of the devices, you will find that individual devices can be enabled and disabled through the portal. Devices can also be enabled and disabled using the Azure CLI.

<a name="Summary"></a>
## Summary ##

In this lab, you created an Azure IoT hub, registered an array of simulated devices, and sent a message to the IoT hub from one of the devices to confirm that everything was set up correctly. You also created an Azure storage account and a blob container inside it and demonstrated that a device simulated in software could upload blobs to it. You may now proceed to the next lab in this series — [Processing IoT Data in Real Time Using Stream Analytics and Machine Learning, Part 2](../2%20-%20Process) — to create an [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics/) job and connect it to the IoT hub.
